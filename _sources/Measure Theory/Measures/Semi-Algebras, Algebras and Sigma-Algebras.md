# Semi-Algebras, Algebras and Sigma-Algebras

````{prf:definition}

A family of subsets $\SSS$ of $\Omega$ is a semi-algebra if it
1.  contains the empty set, i.e., $\emptyset\in\SSS$, 

2.  closed under finite Intersections, i.e., $A, B \in\SSS\implies A \cap B \in\SSS$, and 

3.  the complement of each set in $\SSS$ can be written as a finite disjoint union of other sets in $\SSS$, i.e., $A \in\SSS\implies\exists E_1, \ldots, E_n \in\SSS, \; A = \biguplus_{i=1}^n E_i$.

````{prf:example}
:label: eg:1

Consider the following semi-algebra on $\R$:

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\SSS = \left\{\emptyset\right\}\cup\set{(a, b]}{a, b \in \R, a < b}\cup\set{(a, \infty)}{a \in \R}\cup\set{(-\infty, b]}{b \in \R}\cup\left\{\R\right\}\end{align*}
```

It is easy to verify that it is indeed a semi-algebra. In fact, the definition of semi-algebra arises from the study of this very example. We will construct the famous Lebesgue measure from this semi-algebra, which defines the length of a set.

$\sigma$-Algebras
A family of subsets $\F$ of $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-algebra  if it satisfies the following:
1. $\emptyset\in\F$
2. $\F$ is closed under complements, i.e., $A \in\F\implies A^\complement\in\F$
3. $\F$ is closed under countable unions, i.e., $A_i \in\F\;\forall i \in\Ns\implies\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \in\F$

````{prf:proposition}
:label: pro:4

Let $\SSS$ be a semi-algebra on $\Omega$, and $\A(\SSS)$ the algebra generated by $\SSS$. Then $\A(\SSS)$ consists of all finite disjoint unions of sets in $\SSS$. Mathematically, 

```{math}
\begin{align*}

A \in\A(\SSS)
\iff\exists\left\{S_i\right\}_{i=1}^n \subset\SSS, \; A = \biguplus_{i=1}^n S_i
\end{align*}
```

````{prf:definition}

The Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\B(\R^d)$ on $\R^d$ is defined as the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the collection of all open sets in $\R^d$. Mathematically, 

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\B(\R^d) := \sigma(\tau)
\end{align*}
```

where $\tau$ is the Euclidean topology on $\R^d$.

````{prf:lemma}

Suppose $\CC_1, \CC_2 \subset\Omega$. If for any $E \in\CC_1$, either one of the following holds:
1. $E = F^\complement$ for some $F \in\CC_2$
2. $E = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i$ where $F_i \in\CC_2 \;\forall i \in\Ns$
3. $E = \bigcap_{i=1}^\infty F_i$ where $F_i \in\CC_2 \;\forall i \in\Ns$


then we have 

```{math}
\begin{align*}
\sigma(\CC_1) \subset\sigma(\CC_2)
\end{align*}
```
